## Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── static/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── sources/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

There’s nothing special about `sources/components/`, but that’s where any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components are put.

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [the Astro guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## Add base path in Astro when unique domain is disabled

If you [disable the unique domain](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/#unique-domains),
the site will be hosted under `yourname.gitlab.io/examplerepository/`,
you will need to configure Astro to use the `base` path.

In `astro.config.mjs`, the value for `base` should be your project’s name,
starting with a forward slash - for example, `/examplerepository`.
This ensures Astro understands that your website’s root is `/examplerepository` instead of the default `/`,
especially when your project is hosted at `https://gitlab.com/yourname/examplerepository/`.

```js:title=astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
    base: '/examplerepository',
});
```
